# programming-teaching-resources
A collection of ipython notebooks and R scripts and practice datasets for teaching, learning, and practicing scientific python and R.

This collection of resources was originally created for teaching purposes, specifically in the context of scientific research and data science. Most of the datasets and notebooks contained within are meant to serve this purpose, and are free and available to any who may be interested. I hope that these can be helpful to you in some way!
